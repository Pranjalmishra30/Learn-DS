# Linked List  
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. 
It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.  

We have different kinds of Linked-Lists:
* Singly Linked List  
* Doubly Linked List  
* Circular Linked List
