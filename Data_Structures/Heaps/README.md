# Heaps  
A Heap is a special tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Every level of the tree,except possibly the last,is filled 
and all the nodes are as far left as possible.  

Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

1. **Max-Heap**: 
In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.  

2. **Min-Heap**: 
In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Heaps can be constructed in 2 ways:  
1. Bottom up construction  
2. Top down construction
