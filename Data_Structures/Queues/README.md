# Queues  
A queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first. It is similar to the ticket queue found outside a cinema hall, 
where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

Putting items in the queue is called enqueue, and removing items from the queue is called dequeue.  

We have many different kinds of queues:  
* Simple queue  
* Circular queue  
* Priority queue
* Double ended queue
