# Trees  
A tree data structure simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node,represented as a set of linked nodes.
It is a collection of nodes (starting at a root node),where each node is a data structure consisting of a value and a list of references to child nodes.  

We can have many types of trees:  
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree
