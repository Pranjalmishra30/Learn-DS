# Insertion Sort  

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration. We assume that the first element is already sorted 
then, we select an unsorted element. If that element is greater than the element before it, it is placed on the right otherwise, to the left. This process is repeated
till all elements are in their suitable position.  

Time complexity for this algorithm is **O (n<sup>2</sup>)**.  
Worst case occurs when the array is **reverse sorted**.  
Best case occurs when the array is already sorted. Time complexity is then **O (n)**.
