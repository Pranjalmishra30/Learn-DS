# Binary Search  

Binary search follows divide and conquer approach in which, the list is **divided** into two halves and the item is **compared** with the middle element of the list. 
If the match is found then, the location of middle element is returned otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced 
through the match.  

Time complexity for this algorithm is **O (log n)**.  
The best case occurs when the key is found at the middle element. Time complexity is then **O (1)**.  
For worst and average case, the time complexity is **O (log n)**.
