# Algorithms  
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem. A good algorithm should be optimized in terms of time and space.  
Different types of problems require different types of algorithmic-techniques to be solved in the most optimized manner.  

## Brute Force Algorithms

This is the most *basic* and *simplest* type of algorithm. A Brute Force Algorithm is the **straightforward** approach to a problem i.e., the first approach
that comes to our mind on seeing the problem. More technically it is just like iterating every possibility available to solve that problem.
