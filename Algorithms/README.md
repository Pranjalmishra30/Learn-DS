# Algorithms  
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem. A good algorithm should be optimized in terms of time and space.  
Different types of problems require different types of algorithmic-techniques to be solved in the most optimized manner.  

## [Brute Force Algorithms](https://github.com/Pranjalmishra30/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Algorithms/Brute_Force)

This is the most *basic* and *simplest* type of algorithm. A Brute Force Algorithm is the **straightforward** approach to a problem i.e., the first approach
that comes to our mind on seeing the problem. More technically it is just like iterating every possibility available to solve that problem.  

## [Decrease and Conquer Algorithms](https://github.com/Pranjalmishra30/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Algorithms/Decrease_and_conquer)  

This technique involves the following steps:  
**Decrease** or reduce problem instance to smaller instance of the same problem. **Conquer** the problem by solving smaller instance of the problem 
and finally **Extend** solution of smaller instance to obtain solution to original problem.  

## [Divide and Conquer Algorithms](https://github.com/Pranjalmishra30/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Algorithms/Divide_and_conquer)  

This technique involves the following steps:  
**Divide** the problem into some sub problem. **Conquer** the sub problem by calling it recursively until the sub problem solved. **Combine** the sub problem solution to obtain solution to original problem.
