# Bubble Sort  

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.  
In this way it *bubbles* the largest element (for ascending order) at the end of the array.  
 
 Time complexity for this algorithm is O (n<sup>2</sup>).  
 Best Case: Array is already sorted. Time Complexity is O (n).  
 Worst Case: Array is sorted in reverse order. Time Complexity is O (n<sup>2</sup>).  
    
 Number of key swaps depends on the input.  
 For the best case it is **0** and for the worst case it is **n * (n-1) / 2**.
