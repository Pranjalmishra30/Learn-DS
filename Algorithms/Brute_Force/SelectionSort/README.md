# Selection Sort  

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.  

    Time Complexity for this algorithm is O(n^2).   
    It is same for best case and worst case scenarios.     
    Number of keyswaps is n-1.
