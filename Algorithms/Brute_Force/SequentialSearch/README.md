# Sequential Search  

A Sequential (Linear) search sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds an element that matches the target value.  
If the algorithm reaches the end of the list, the search terminates unsuccessfully.  

Time Complexity for this algorithm is O( n<sup>2</sup> ).  
Best Case: Element is found at index 0. Time Complexity is O(1).  
Worst Case: Element is found at index n-1. Time Complexity is O(n).
