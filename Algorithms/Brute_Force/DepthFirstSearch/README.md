# Depth First Search   

Depth First search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The basic idea is to start from a source node, mark that node as visited and move to the adjacent unvisited node and continue this until there is no unvisited adjacent node. Then backtrack and check for other unmarked nodes and traverse them.  
  
DFS can be solved using the adjacency matrix or adjacency list.  
V = Num of vertices & E = Num of edges. 

Time Complexity:  
Adj Mat:  O( V<sup>2</sup> )  
Adj List: O( V+E )
